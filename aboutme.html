        <hr>
        <p>Computer Engineering major and Linux fanatic who plays <em>way</em> too many tabletop games. In my freetime (in addition to unhealthy amounts of DND), I also do a lot of coding, 3D printing, fiction writing, digital art, and running. My favorite coding languages are C, Rust, BASH and ARM Assembly. I am also conversational in Spanish.</p>

        <p class="sectionHeaders">What I'm working on</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Last summer, I Co-Op'ed at Qualcomm, working with their Core Platform PMIC team to design a new framework to assist with debugging. I learned a lot about embedded firmware development, and got the chance to work with a lot of really smart people. All in all, I had a blast!</p>

        <p>Last fall, I returned to Council Rock to continue work on their new line of solar management systems, doing even more embedded and edge network goodness in C++ and Python. It was great seeing the fruits of my labor from 2020 grow into something incredible, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of making it even better.</p>

        <p>For this summer, I have accepted a co-op offer with Datadog! I'm ecstatic, even though I don't know what I'll be working on yet! I'm sure it'll be really cool!</p>

        <!--<p style><em>If you'd like to hire me, I'm looking for work! I'm available for a Co-Op next Summer of 2022!</em></p>-->

        <p>As for the fun stuff, I have several projects in the works.</p>
