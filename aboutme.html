			<p class="sectionHeaders">Hi! I'm Will!</p>
			<p>
			Hello! I am Will Nilges. I'm a Computer Engineering major who's into Linux and free and open source software. I love programming, and I do a lot of computer stuff for myself, for money, and for open source communities when I can. I have 3 years of Java and C# experience, 5 years of Python experience, and I have a decent grasp on C, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm planning on learning Rust as well.</p>
			<p class="sectionHeaders">What I'm working on</p>
			<p>
			Currently, I'm enrolled in RIT taking
			<ul>
			<li>Digital System Design I (CMPE-160)</li>
			<li>Intro to Software Engineering (SWEN-261)</li>
			<li>Project Based Calculus II (MATH-182)</li>
			<li>University Physics I (PHYS-211)</li>
			<li>Ninja Training (WFIT-91)</li>
			</ul>
			and I need to find out why I'm still not in MLSP-301.
			</p>
			<p>
			As for the fun stuff, I have several projects in the works.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Bettervent</strong></p>
			<p>
			Bettervent is a scheduling app that I am developing for Computer Science House. We have tablets outside our special rooms that run this software. It displays the current time, which event is currently taking place, and which events are coming up. It also lets people make short, quick reservations for if they need to snag it for a bit.
			</p>
			<p>
			Bettervent is open source, and you can find my repo on GitHub. You can also look at Reservator that I tried to fork from, but that app ended up being an overengineered undocumented nightmare, so I tossed everything out and started writing my own from scratch because... well... Just look through the Reservator code and you'll understand :)

			Currently, I'm working on the fragment-trial branch, which I made to test out a different way of switching between the three features of the app. Check out the README for more information.
			</p>
			<p><strong>BOA</strong></p>
			<p>
			BOA is a Unity game that I am currently developing in C#. It is a fast-paced, PVP, multiplayer shooter with a heavy focus on mobility and reaction. I drew inspiration from Terraria and OpenArena. Terraria PVP is a lot of fun in the 2D voxel-like environments that comprise that game, but I'd like it to be faster, and more focused on the combat. OpenArena is a lot like that, and also captures the general feel I want for the game.
			</p>
			<p>
			I've had to put it on hold for a while as I focus on school, work, and my projects for CSH, but it'll (hopefully) be done by next year.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Hostile Takeover</strong></p>
			<p>
			Hostile Takeover is a real time strategy Android game I am developing. You, as a company, must buy out all of your competitors before they get big enough to buy you out. It's got most of its game mechanics done. All I need to do is dev the UI and it should be out and ready for play!
