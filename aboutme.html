        <hr>
        <p>Computer Engineering major and Linux fanatic who plays <em>way</em> too many tabletop games. In my freetime (in addition to unhealthy amounts of DND), I also do a fair bit of coding, 3D printing, digital art, and running. My favorite coding languages are C, Rust, BASH and ARM Assembly. I am also conversational in Spanish, becuase I think language is neat.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>This summer, I Co-Op'ed at Qualcomm, working with their Core Platform PMIC team to design a new framework to assist with debugging. I learned a lot about embedded firmware development, and got the chance to work with a lot of really smart people. All in all, I had a blast!</p>

        <p>This fall, I'm returning to Council Rock to continue work on their new line of solar management systems, doing even more embedded and edge network goodness in C++ and Python. I'm really excited to get to play with this new tech, and hopefully build on what I learned last year.</p>

        <!--<p style><em>If you'd like to hire me, I'm looking for work! I'm available for a Co-Op next Summer of 2022!</em></p>-->

        <p>As for the fun stuff, I have several projects in the works.</p>
