			<p class="sectionHeaders">Hi! I'm Will!</p>
			<p>
Hello! I am Will Nilges. I'm a Computer Engineering major who's into Linux and free and open source software. I'm heavily into Robotics and I'm actively looking for ways to get more into the Robotics scene. I love programming, and I do a lot of computer stuff for myself, for money, and for open source communities when I can. I know Java, C#, Python, C, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, and I want to learn Rust at some point as well.</p>
			<p class="sectionHeaders">What I'm working on</p>
			<p>
Currently, I'm enrolled in RIT taking
<ul>
<li>Computer Science for AP Students (CSCI 140)</li>
<li>Intro to Computer Engineering (CMPE 110)</li>
<li>Project Based Calculus I (MATH 180)</li>
<li>First Year Writing (UWRT 150)</li>
<li>Beginning Spanish II (MLSP 202)</li>
</ul>
and I really need to plan for next semester! Oh god!
			</p>
			<p>
As for the fun stuff, I have several projects in the works.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Bettervent</strong></p>
			<p>
Bettervent is a scheduling app that I am developing for Computer Science House. We have tablets outside our special rooms that run this software. It displays the current time, which event is currently taking place, and which events are coming up. It also lets people make short, quick reservations for if they need to snag it for a bit.
