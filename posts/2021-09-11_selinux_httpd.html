<p>I’ve been having this weird problem with my httpd dev instance where, when I try to serve content, sometimes, seemingly at random, I’ll get 403’ed when it serves. My file permissions are correct, my ownership is correct, but I just <em>won’t</em> be able to access the content. Very annoying.</p>
<p>Today, I figured out the problem: SELinux.</p>
<p>To fix these weird issues, you have to tell SELinux that everything is ok, and you aren’t getting hacked:</p>
<div class="codeBlock"><pre><code>chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html</code></pre></div>
<p>Should work after that.</p>
