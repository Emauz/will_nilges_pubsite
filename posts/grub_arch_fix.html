<p class="articleHeaders">Installing GRUB on Arch</p>
<h3>13 March, 2019</h3>

Ok so I'm making this post out of annoyance. I might even edit the wiki to include this because this was really weird with an NVMe drive. Or maybe I'm just a simpleton.

When you install Arch Linux, you should mount your EFI partition (in my case /dev/sda2) to /mnt/boot/efi.
<br>
The steps go (and for reference my root partition is /dev/sda6)
<br>
<div id="code">
mount /dev/sda7 /mnt
<br>
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot/
<br>
arch-chroot /mnt
<br>
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=Arch
<br>
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</div><br>
and then it should work.
