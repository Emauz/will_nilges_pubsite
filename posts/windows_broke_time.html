  I've had this issue several times in the past: After installing Arch to a machine and rebooting a few times, the time may inexplicably be wrong. When you run <p id="code">timedatectl</p> you might get something like this back:
  <p id="code">
    Local time: Mon 2018-12-24 10:21:41 EST # Something incorrect
    <br>
    Universal time: Mon 2018-12-24 14:21:41 ETC # Is probably in EST or whatever your timezone is.
    <br>
    RTC time: Mon 2018-12-24 19:21:41
    <br>
    Time zone: America/New_York (EST, -0500)
    <br>
    System clock synchronized: yes
    <br>
    NTP service: inactive
    <br>
    RTC in local TZ: no
    <br>
  </p>
  The important things you will notice is that Universal Time won't be UTC and Local Time might be something weird.
  <br>
  Anyway, the point is you fix it with this:
</p>
<p id="code">
  timedatectl set-ntp true
</p>
<p>
  and then in Windows, you have to create a file named WindowsTimeFixUTC.reg with the following contents and then double click on it to merge the contents with the registry:
</p>

<p id="code">
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation]
 "RealTimeIsUniversal"=dword:00000001

</p>
