<p class="articleHeaders">How to set up networking on an uncooperative CLI</p>
<p><strong>29 October, 2018</strong><br></p>
<p>So, if you have something like a ThinkPad X380 Yoga (or like, any of the newer, thiner ThinkPads) that has something like a proprietary Ethernet port <strong>or no network port at all</strong> then here's how you set up networking and get your hardware pinging the internet on a bare Ubuntu (or not) install.</p>
<p>First, you need to add the device to</p>
<p id="code">/etc/network</p>
<p>Add the device to your `interfaces` file which might look something like this:</>
  <p id="code">
    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system<br>
    # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).<br>
    <br>
    source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*<br>
    <br>
    # The loopback network interface<br>
    auto lo<br>
    iface lo inet loopback<br>
  </p>
  <p>You will need to find the device name using</p>
  <p id="code">ifconfig -a</p>
  <p>and then add the device to this like this:</p>
  <p id="code">iface *DEVICE NAME* inet dhcp</p>
  <p>Then, you will need to hit it with an</p>
  <p id="code">ifdown *DEVICE NAME*</p>
  <p>and then an</p>
  <p id="code">ifup *DEVICE NAME*</p>
  <p>and then, assuming the divine forces will actually allow it, you should be able to network!</p>
