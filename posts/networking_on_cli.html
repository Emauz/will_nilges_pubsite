<p class="articleHeaders">How to set up networking on an uncooperative CLI</p>

<hr>
<p>So, if you have something like a ThinkPad X380 Yoga (or like, any of the newer, thiner ThinkPads) that has something like a proprietary Ethernet port <strong>or no network port at all</strong> then here's how you set up networking and get your hardware pinging the internet on a bare Ubuntu (or not) install.</p>
<p>First, you need to add the device to</p>
<code>/etc/network</code>
<p>Add the device to your `interfaces` file which might look something like this:</p>
<div class="codeBlock"><pre><code>    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
    source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
    # The loopback network interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
</code></pre></div>
  <p>You will need to find the device name using</p>
  <code>ifconfig -a</code>
  <p>and then add the device to this like this:</p>
  <code>iface &ltDEVICE NAME&gt inet dhcp</code>
  <p>Then, you will need to hit it with an</p>
  <code>ifdown &ltDEVICE NAME&gt</code>
  <p>and then an</p>
  <code>ifup &ltDEVICE NAME&gt</code>
  <p>and then, assuming the divine forces will actually allow it, you should be able to network!</p>
  <!--<p>Nothing, yet.</p>-->
