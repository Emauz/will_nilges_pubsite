    <h2><strong>BOA</strong></h2>
    <p>BOA is a Unity game that I am currently developing in C#. It's a fast-paced, PVP, multiplayer shooter with a heavy focus on mobility and reaction time that drew a lot of inspiration from Terraria and OpenArena. Terraria PVP is a lot of fun in the 2D voxel-like environments that comprise that game, but I'd like it to be faster, and more focused on the combat. OpenArena is a lot like that, and also captures the general feel I want for the game.</p>
    <p>I've had to put it on hold for a while as I focus on school, work, and my projects for CSH, but it'll (hopefully) be done by <s>mid 2019</s> <s>2020™</s> <s>2021™™</s>.</p>
