    <h2><strong>SampleZone</strong></h2>
    <p>
    SampleZone is a command line mixer made by Steve Greene (sgreene570) I contribute to. It uses ncurses to allow for mixing and pitch shifting of audio files. There's a lot planned for this program, so stay tuned! Follow upstream development <a href="https://www.github.com/sgreene570/sampleZone">here</a>.
