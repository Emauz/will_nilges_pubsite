<p><strong>ShelfLife</strong></p>
<p>ShelfLife is a utility used to automatically monitor and manage resources on an OKD cluster. When it is active on a cluster, it monitors the projects consuming resources, looking for anything that goes stale. What "stale" means is up to you, but by default, it looks for projects that haven't been worked on for a period of time, and send increasingly urgent emails to their owners before removing all compute resources and eventually archiving the project in S3. It has a plethora of features for categorizing projects for stricter or looser timelines, backup and archival features, and soon, a management frontend.
