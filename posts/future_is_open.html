<p>Heyoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!</p>
<p>The Future is Open is now open for registration! It's a FOSS conference happening at the RIT MAGIC center to promote Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) with a slew of cool events and workshops. Come on down at 10am on Saturday, October 26 and get FOSSy with it.</p>
<p>Why do I bring this up? Because I'm running an event! I will be giving a workshop from 12-4 detailing how to get Linux booted on <em>your</em> machine! If you're curious about Linux, but have no idea where to start, attend this workshop!</p>
