		<p>Welcome to this small little thing I might do eventually! At some point, I'll get around to making a place for me to store all my tech notes and knowhow</p>
		<p>Here, you will find mostly miscellaneous tech advice and no-nonsense guides to doing things in Linux. I might also rant on here. Who knows?</p>
		<p>Additionally, I'll probably put some neat-o project sites on here. It'll be great!</p>

		<p class="articleHeaders"> How to install Bumblebee on Arch </p>
		<p><strong>29 October, 2018</strong><br></p>
		<p>Do this after installing Xorg but before installing a DE. The next time I install Arch I'll actually blog about it properly but this is something that might be useful real quick. Also, if you're trying to install Bumblebee on any other flavor,
		<br>
		don't.</p>
		<p id="code">
			sudo pacman -S bumblebee mesa xf86-video-intel lib32-virtualgl lib32-nvidia-utils
			<br>
			sudo gpasswd -a $USER bumblebee
			<br>
			sudo systemctl enable bumblebee

		<p class="articleHeaders">How to set up networking on an uncooperative CLI</p>
		<p><strong>29 October, 2018</strong><br></p>
		<p>So, if you have something like a ThinkPad X380 Yoga (or like, any of the newer, thiner ThinkPads) that has something like a proprietary Ethernet port <strong>or no network port at all</strong> then here's how you set up networking and get your hardware pinging the internet on a bare Ubuntu (or not) install.</p>
		<p>First, you need to add the device to <div id="code">/etc/network</div></p>
		<p>Add the device to your `interfaces` file which might look something like this:</>
		<p>
		<div id="code">
		# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system<br>
		# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).<br>
		<br>
		source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*<br>
		<br>
		# The loopback network interface<br>
auto lo<br>
iface lo inet loopback<br>
		</div>
		</p>
	<p>You will need to find the device name using</p>
	<p><div id="code">ifconfig -a</div></p>
	<p>and then add the device to this like this:</p>
	<p><div id="code">iface *DEVICE NAME* inet dhcp</div></p>
	<p>Then, you will need to hit it with an</p>
	<p><div id="code">ifdown *DEVICE NAME*</div></p>
	<p>and then an</p>
	<p><div id="code">ifup *DEVICE NAME*</div></p>
	<p>and then, assuming the divine forces will actually allow it, you should be able to network!</p>
