		<p>Welcome to this small little thing I might do eventually! At some point, I'll get around to making a place for me to store all my tech notes and knowhow</p>
		<p>Here, you will find mostly miscellaneous tech advice and no-nonsense guides to doing things in Linux. I might also rant on here. Who knows?</p>
		<p>Additionally, I'll probably put some neat-o project sites on here. It'll be great!</p>

		<p>I need to get to my other thonkpad and get some code...</p>
		<p>Until then, you need to add the device to `/etc/network`.</p>
		<p>Add the device to your `interfaces` file which might look something like this:</p>
		<p>
		<em>
		# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system<br>
		# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).<br>
		<br>
		source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*<br>
		<br>
		# The loopback network interface<br>
auto lo<br>
iface lo inet loopback<br>
		</em>
		</p>
		<p>You'll need to find the device name using <em>ifconfig -a</em> and thenadd the device to this like this:<em> iface *DEVICE NAME* inet dhcp</em></p>
<p>Then, you'll need to hit it with an <em>ifdown *DEVICE NAME*</em> and then an <em>ifup *DEVICE NAME*</em></p>
		<!--<p>Nothing, yet.</p>-->
