		<p>Welcome to this small little thing I might do eventually! At some point, I'll get around to making a place for me to store all my tech notes and knowhow</p>
		<p>Here, you will find mostly miscellaneous tech advice and no-nonsense guides to doing things in Linux. I might also rant on here. Who knows?</p>
		<p>Additionally, I'll probably put some neat-o project sites on here. It'll be great!</p>
