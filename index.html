		<p>Hello, welcome to my tiny corner of tech knowledge.</p>
		<p>Here, you will find mostly miscellaneous tech advice, no-nonsense guides, and occasional notes.</p>
		<p>This site is also open to suggestions and user-submitted content. If you have some nifty advice about Linux, submit a pull request!</p>
		<p>Additionally, I'll probably put some neat-o project sites and/or pages on here. It'll be great!</p>
