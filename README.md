This is my personal site. I keep descriptions of all my best projects on here, as well as various little blogs or notes or guides I come up with. You can also find my reusme here.

This site was written completely from scratch. It's pretty awful how it works, but hey, I'm a computer engineer, not a frontend web developer. I've recently switched to using `pandoc` to convert markdown posts to HTML to put on the website, so excuse any formatting issues you might encounter. Then again, handwritten HTML isn't much better than what a robot can do :P

Please enjoy, and if you have anything to add, open an issue or a PR!
