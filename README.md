This is my personal site. I keep descriptions of all my best projects on here, as well as various little blogs or notes or guides I come up with. You can also find my reusme here.

This site was written completely from scratch. It's pretty awful how it works, but hey, I'm a computer engineer, not a frontend web developer. Despite that, I've made the abosolutely goblinoid decision to render Markdown using JavaScript in order to serve my ramblings to you. Most of my site has been re-written to be rendered from Markdown files instead of hardcoded as HTML. I feel like that'll make it easier to write and add posts in exchange for some flexibility with the design, but I don't really intend on doing anything that crazy with this site, so I'll live with it.

To add a post, just plop it into the `posts/md/` directory, then make an entry in `postList.js` in the appropriate list. 

Please enjoy, and if you have anything interesting you'd like to add, I accept PRs.
